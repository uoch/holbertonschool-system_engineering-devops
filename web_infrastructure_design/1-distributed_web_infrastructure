Design of Three-Server Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com

Components:

Load Balancer (HAproxy)
Web Server (Nginx)
Application Server
Database (MySQL)
Server Configuration:

Server 1: Load Balancer and Web Server
Server 2: Application Server
Server 3: Database (Primary node)
Load Balancer (HAproxy):

The load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and optimal resource utilization.
The load balancer is configured with a Round Robin distribution algorithm, where each incoming request is forwarded to the next available server in a cyclic manner.
Round Robin algorithm ensures that the workload is evenly distributed among the servers.
Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:

In this infrastructure, the load balancer enables an Active-Passive setup.
Active-Passive setup means that the load balancer directs all the traffic to the active server, while the passive server remains idle, ready to take over if the active server fails.
This setup provides high availability but does not utilize the passive server unless a failover occurs.
Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Cluster:

The database consists of a Primary node and a Replica node, forming a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster.
The Primary node is Server 3 in this infrastructure and acts as the main read-write node for the database.
The Replica node is a copy of the Primary node and is kept in sync with it by replicating the data changes.
The Replica node (Slave) can be used for read operations but cannot accept write operations directly.
Difference between Primary and Replica Nodes:

The Primary node is responsible for handling both read and write operations, making it the authoritative source for data modifications.
The Replica node synchronizes its data with the Primary node and can be used for read operations, offloading read traffic from the Primary node.
In the application, read operations can be distributed between the Primary and Replica nodes, providing better read scalability and performance.
Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Points of Failure (SPOF):

The infrastructure lacks redundancy for the load balancer, web server, application server, and database.
If any of these components fail, the website www.foobar.com will experience downtime or service disruption.
To address this, additional servers and components can be added with proper redundancy and failover mechanisms.
Security Issues:

The infrastructure lacks a firewall to protect the servers from unauthorized access or malicious attacks.
Additionally, there is no implementation of HTTPS (TLS/SSL) for secure communication between clients and servers.
Implementing a firewall and enabling HTTPS are crucial for enhancing the security of the infrastructure and protecting sensitive data.
Lack of Monitoring:

The infrastructure does not include any monitoring system to track the health, performance, and availability of servers and services.
Monitoring tools should be implemented to provide visibility into the infrastructure, detect issues, and enable proactive troubleshooting.
